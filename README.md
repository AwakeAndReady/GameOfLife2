# "Game of Live" 

This Game is just called "Game of Live" because it is about live itself. It is not Conway's "game of Live"!
The inspiration for this game came to me during my time when I started to learn programming with Java, using the book "Java ist auch eine Insel" in 2016.

## Run the game:
Make sure the Java SDK is installed on your machine.
```
cd gameOfLife2
javac *.java
java GameOfLife2
```

Enjoy!
